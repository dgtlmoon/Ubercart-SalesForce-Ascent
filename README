This is initial code for integrating SalesForce Ascent enhanced services with Ubercart

It has a very different API to the regular Salesforce API so that's why this code is not based
on the existing Ubercart modules.

Usage:

* Configure the actions at admin/store/ca/add
  - Step 1.
      Title - "Synchronise order account with salesforce"
      Trigger - "Customer completes checkout"
      Weight - 0 (IMPORTANT!)
      [Save with no conditions]
      Actions - "Queue salesforce<->ubercart account upsert"
  - Step 2 (setup adding the account to Ascent)
      goto admin/store/ca/add
      Title - "Synchronise product sales with ascent"
      Trigger - "Customer completes checkout"
      Weight - 2 (IMPORTANT!)    
      [Save with no conditions]
      Actions - "Queue salesforce<->ubercart sales order upsert"
    
    
* Configure your API key information admin/store/settings/uc_salesforce
